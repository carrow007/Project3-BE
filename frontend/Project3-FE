#Drinks On Us 

##React/Node App


##The MVP

For our project we wanted to get the following checked off to statify our MVP:

1. Use an external API in this case the Absolut API.

2. Use FireBase to store the users data when Favorting/Deleting a Drink.

3. Use Firebase for Authentication so that when loged in the user would have a unique favorites page.

4. Use React Routes to organize the flow of our single page web app.

5. Use Bootstrap and our own css to sytle the page for better UI.

6. Deploy our app using Heroku.


##The wbsite's details.

There is a main search page, and on this page  the user can search for a specifc drink as well as see a featured drink. The user can favorite the drink and if loged in it will live in their database.

The user can select "Search By Drink" and the page will re-render with six buttons and the user can select a base and randomly generated results will render to the page. The user has the ability to save from here as well.

The header or Nav bar allows the user to navigate to "Drinks on Us" (the main search page), about (to learn about the developers), view favorites ( to view all favorited drinks or if logged in their favorited drinks), search (to bring them to the main search page), and login.


##Things that we are still workings on.
 

1. We have a star rating component which we got from an NPM package. currently the user can change the state of the stars from 0-5, but we do not have a way of saving that to the database so that the user can view what their rating was for later.
